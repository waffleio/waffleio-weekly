# ðŸ“† Waffle Weekly

A report of weekly progress for Waffle.io projects (boards).

## Overview

Some Waffle.io users need to share status with stakeholders outside of the team members who use a Waffle.io project on a daily basis. These stakeholders might be leadership, clients, or other teams who aren't reviewing the Waffle.io project on a frequent basis or don't have access to GitHub (and therefore don't have access to Waffle.io). While you can [view issues closed in the past 30 days](https://help.waffle.io/faq/done-column-closing-issues/can-i-viewed-my-archived-issues) on Waffle.io's Throughput report, it doesn't provide context about epics, new issues, etc in an easy to consume format.

Waffle Weekly is a project to explore additional progress reporting for Waffle.io projects.

## Roadmap

This project uses Waffle.io for [backlog and in-progress work](https://waffle.io/waffleio/waffleio-weekly).

[![Waffle.io - Columns and their card count](https://badge.waffle.io/waffleio/waffleio-weekly.svg?columns=all)](https://waffle.io/waffleio/waffleio-weekly)

## How It Works

Queries the Waffle.io and GitHub APIs for status of GitHub project(s) included in the Waffle.io project (board).

## Usage

1. Clone this repo locally.
2. Create a `dev` file in the root of this project with the following contents and update with the Waffle.io API Key:

```
export waffleApiSecret='123456'

export ghApiToken='123456'

export mailgunUser='123456'
export mailgunPass='123456'
export mailgunFrom='person@example.com'
export mailgunTo='person1@example.com,person2@example.com'

export waffleProject='owner/project'
export inProgressLabels='planned|in progress|needs review|deploying|'

export daysToReport=7

node app.js
```

3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to install dependencies.
5. Open `http://localhost:3000/` in a web browser to view the report in a web browser or open `http://localhost:3000/email` in a web browser to sent an email version of the report

Optionally

- Run `nodemon --exec "bash dev"` to automatically restart the project when changes are made.
- Run `npm test` to run Jest tests in `--watch` mode.
